# HTML5 template

Full blown HTML5 template for quick prototyping, using most common libraries and frameworks.

### Q&A

***Why not use [Bower](http://bower.io/)?***  
Because Bower just adds additional clutter, bunch of files you won't use and you still need to add everything yourself in the main HTML file. The purpose of this template is to provide fastest possible way of prototying, and remove all additional worries about npm, script versions, including files etc.

***Why not use CDN?***  
Only jQuery, Modernizr and Angular are available on rock-solid CDNs. The rest of the scripts are hosted on a bit "alternative" CDNs, such as [cdnjs.com](http://cdnjs.com). From experience, these services sometimes tend to have hiccups, making your complete app unusable till the hiccup is gone. Having everything on your [dev/local] server means it will work no matter what - even if your internet connection is experiencing troubles or you are offline.  

Once again, this is mainly for quick *prototyping*. You will most likely want to organize/optimize things differently for a production-ready app.
